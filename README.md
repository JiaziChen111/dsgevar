# Forecasting with DSGE-VAR model: an application for Brazilian economy
Here I store some (messy) Matlab codes used in my masters thesis, which proposes to use a small open economy 
DSGE model as a prior distribution in the estimation of a VAR model
for the Brazilian economy, using the DSGE-VAR* methodology. The main goal is to evaluate the relative performance of the forecasts, 
generated by the DSGE-VAR, in relation to alternative models, such as a Bayesian VAR with Minnesota prior and diffuse prior, 
and an estimated DSGE.
